कितना ख़तरनाक नजरिया है! कोई हमारे बेगूसराय जिला को बिना कोई राय-परामर्श के अनुमंडल बना देगा तो उसकी चूलें न हिला देंगे। कोई मेरी मर्ज़ी के बगैर मेरे घर, जमीन का फैसला करेगा तो उसका क्या हश्र करेंगे?
आप ही सोचिए कल आपके गांव से राय किये बगैर उसे मुहल्ला बना दिया जाय, आपके प्रखंड को पंचायत, आपके जिला को अनुमंडल बना दे। आपके राज्य को केंद्रशासित प्रदेश, उसे बांट कर कई टुकड़ा कर दे। इसमें आपसे कोई राय न ले, तो क्या करेंगे आप?
कल को ऐसे लोग तो अपनी राजनीति की रोटी सेंकने को देश को भी बिना पूछे अडानी-अंबानी, अमेरिका आदि किसी को गिरवी रख देंगे। संभल जाओ, हुलेले, हुलेले से बचें, थोड़ा अपना दिमाग इस्तेमाल करें!
मुहल्ले में दो टुच्चे लोफर के डर से घर बेच मुहल्ला बदल लेने वाले अभी डल झील के शिकारे को घर बनाएंगे! गांव के दो द,बंग रंगदार अ,पराधी के डर से, गांव छोड़ शहर में दुबक जाने वाले आज कश्मीर में प्लाट खरीदने का दम भर रहे हैं।
न,क्सलियों के कथित डर से, अपना घर-बार छोड़ प्रवासी बने लोगों ने अब देश के लिए जम्मू-कश्मीर में बसने का प्रण लिया है। देश के लिए प्राण जाय तो जाय! गुजरात में ठाकोर सेना से पी,टने वालों को न बचाने वाले पीएम और गृह मंत्री, आ,तंकवादियों से रक्षा कर जम्मू-कश्मीर में सबको बसाएंगे!
महाराष्ट्र में राज ठाकरे के गुं,डों से पीटकर भागने वाले, जम्मू-कश्मीर में आतंकवादियों से छाती ठोंक भिड़ जाएंगे, वहीं घर बनाएंगे।
मणिपुर में बार-बार पी,टने वाले, जम्मू-कश्मीर के अल,गाववादियों को उनकी औकात बता, वहीं बसेंगे। नागालैंड, असम, बंगाल, पंजाब, कर्नाटक में पी,टे जाने वाले इतने मज़बूत हो गए हैं कि कश्मीर में खूं,खार आ,तंकवादियों को पटखनी देकर उन्हें खदेड़, वहीं ठिकाना बना लेंगे।
घर में दो जून की रोटी के जद्दोजहद करने वाले उन साथियों के जज़्बात को भी सलाम, जो कश्मीर में करोड़ो खर्च कर बंगला बनाने, आशियाना सजाने और बड़ा रिहायशी होटल खोलने का हौसला रखते हैं। उन सबों को आज के सियासी कवायद की बधाई!"

Rumbo a las PASO

La guerra de encuestas, a pleno: aparecieron 12 pronósticos para la presidencial en sólo 48 horas

Cómo está la pelea entre Alberto Fernández y Mauricio Macri, a 9 días de la elección. Este sábado arranca la prohibición para publicar sondeos.



El promedio de las 12 encuestas (en todos los casos se tuvo en cuenta las tablas que incluían a los indecisos) da una diferencia de sólo 2,75 puntos a favor de Alberto F.: 39,48% contra 36,73% de Macri. Una distancia similar a la que publicó Clarín en el arranque de la semana, lo que podría hacer suponer cierta estabilidad en la intención de voto.

F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"Request you to read and completely understand my comment:


Brother , Freedom is what they asked for , I would like to ask If Muslims are not in better position in Kashmir and India  as compared to Palestine , syria and Pok occupied Kashmir ? 
India offers secularism which means to live with other religions with peace and have democracy. I hope you should be aware of the fact that when Kashmiris were free they were attacked by Pakistan Army, and people who protesting to have freedom again will again be occupied by Pak army because you as a Kashmiris dont have ordinance industry to make Guns and protect yourself from Pakistan.

Or do you say that Kashmiri people  ask for freedom from India just because at the end they are happy to be possessed by Pakistan as its a Muslim country so they cannot say the truth on the face ? Well let me tell you , Pok occupied kashmiris have always willingness to get back to indian side. See yourself : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvsi-yPmmwo

And you can see the condition of Pakistan its even worse ,destroyed economy  they are all Jihadis surrounded by TTP talibani terror camps who killed 200 innocent school children. In Pakistan there is no control of the PM and supreme control lies in hands of Army of Pak. 
 
If article 370 is removed there are people who will protest as they are blindfolded by politicians and we see many who have high hopes and say that this is a good decision. Everyone has their own thinking."

F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"Recall how demonetisation has met none of its stated, and shifting objectives, including controlling terrorists, black money and fake currency. Will Modi Govt., face same fate here of rewriting the political landscape of the country. Rajya Sabha approved the resolution abrogating Article 370 for J&K and a bill to bifurcate the state into two union territories, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh,  when mainstream leaders have been arrested, phone networks cut, Broadband internet and cable TV services entirely shut down and Section 144 of the CRPC enacted. How will revoking its special status affect the autonomy of the state? How will the bifurcation change the political landscape of the state? Modi Govt., has fulfilled its election promise without caring much for its objectives and purpose. With the Centre’s decision, political disagreement has also taken centre stage. However I sincerely wish Modi Govt. total success so that bloodshed can be avoided and integration with Kashmiri people may take place in true sense."
F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"In all parts of India, Modi Govt has totally failed to provide jobs. Four out of 10 youth who received vocational training are out of the labour force, and a significant chunk of those in the workforce remain unemployed. 1.8% of the population reported receiving formal  vocational/ technical training in 2017-18. 5.6% reported receiving informal vocational training (such as hereditary, self-learning, and on the job training). This means 93% of the population did not receive any vocational/technical training from either formal or informal sources. The youth (15-29 years) comprised more than half of the people who received formal  vocational/ technical training. On the whole, most youth remain outside the ambit of formal training, and many of those who undergo months of vocational training at their own cost remain jobless. Although the PMKVY aims to provide training free of cost, most of the youth who have received formal training have had to bear the cost of training, the PLFS data shows. 
But does Modi Govt have an alternative plan? Modi's budget speech at least gave no indication that the government has a credible plan to address India’s unemployment challenge."
F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"It was easy for them to get jobs in Jammu and Kashmir since people of Jammu & Kashmir could not compete with them. “Maharaja Hari Singh was very much concerned about the issue
and in order to address the concern of Kashmiri pandits & Dogras, Mahraja Hari Singh enacted article 35 A under notification number I-L/84 on 20th April 1927 to define state subjects (Mulki) . “The article gave Jammu and Kashmir a carte blanche to determine the ‘permanent residents’ of the state & grant them special rights and privileges in state sector jobs, acquisition of property
within the state, public aid and welfare schemes. The notification I-L/84 classified four grades of “State Subjects” (Mulki). “Class I –Those persons who were born and residing in the state before the reign of Maharaja Gulab Singh and those who had settled and been permanently residing before 1885. Class II – Those persons who had settled in the state before 1911 and also acquired
immovable property. “Class III – Included those permanently residing in the state and who acquired any immovable property after ten years of continuous residence “Class IV – Included those persons those not covered under Class I,II,III”."
F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"Like Article 370 extended to other states. “Article 371F – Special provision with respect to Sikkim““ Article 371 G – Special provision with respect to Mizoram “Article 371 H – Special provision with respect to Arunachal Pradesh“ “Article 371 I – Special provision with respect to Goa “All these provisions cater the needs of special circumstances that exist in those areas in order to provide the constitutional remedies for various socio-economic challenges. “In the case of article 35 A the provision mandates that no act of the legislature coming under it can be challenged for violating the constitution. “In 1920s during the rule of Mahraja Hari Singh, demands had been raised by the Kashmiri Pandits and Dogras that outsiders should not be allowed to settle in the state to take away the opportunities of acquiring property and government jobs. “At that time people of west Punjab neighbouring Jammu and Kashmir were highly educated as compared to people of Jammu and Kashmir"

F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,Is Article 35 against the unity of country?  The fact of the matter is that article of similar nature has been adopted by many states in India which extends them special status. “The myth perpetrated about Article 35-A of Jammu and Kashmir by those who are shouting loud against it are actually misleading people. Himachal Pradesh inspired by article 35-A also enacted law with similar nature that of Jammu and Kashmir. “Besides there are 11 states that have privilege of special status of similar nature with respect to Jammu and Kashmir.“The articles that accorded special status to other states are as follows.““ Article 371 – Special provision with respect to Maharashtra and Gujarat “Article 371A – Special provision with respect to Nagaland “Article 371 B – Special provision with respect to Assam “Article 371C – Special provision with respect to Manipur “Article 371D & 371 E – Special provision with respect to Andhra Pradesh
F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"The Presidential order signed by the President of India has not scrapped Article 370. But invoking this very article special status of Jammu & Kashmir has been withdrawn. Thus Article 370 is very much on the statute book. 
Article 370 has been emended earlier 96 times. After all, it is Article 370 of our own constitution and not of Pakistan! It is a constitution that we wrote and amended 96 times already. Can't we change one more time and remove that outdated Article 370?"

F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"Gujarat has given great leaders as well as simple script to the nation.
India has more English speakers than Great Britain and most of them are polyglots and yet India is unable to provide equal education/information regardless the medium of instruction through transcription, transliteration and translation. Most world languages have modified their alphabets and use most modern alphabet in writings. Vedic Sanskrit alphabet have been modified to Devanagari and to simplest Gujanagari(Gujarati) script and yet Hindi is taught in a very printing ink wasting non cursive complex script to millions of children in India. Why not adopt a simple script at national level? Indian states can retain their languages, scripts and culture by teaching highly propagated Hindi/Sanskrit in regional scripts to impart technical education through a script converter or in India's simplest Gujanagari script along with a Roman script to revive Brahmi script.

F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"This man is a number one fraud, a viciously deceitful individual and a bone chilling wicked. 
He told all the fantastic words and delivered a long lecture to hide his real intention. 
He will do nothing good for the people of Kashmir. 
Let us tell you what he will do now.

(1) Modi will allow outsiders to buy land and settle in J & K.
(2) Modi will distribute land to the outsiders to settle in J & K.
(3) Modi will allow the outsiders to takeover the businesses in J & K
(4) Modi will handover the vital projects to outsiders.
(5) Modi will provide maximum jobs to the people of other states.
(6) Millions and millions of outsiders will be allowed to infiltrate in J & K under different options and opportunities.
 
The impact will be dangerous. 
The demography of J & K will drastically change and the J & K will not remain a Muslim majority state in India. 
The Muslims will turn into a minority group in their own state. 
Once the Muslims become the minority group the RSS terrorists will start lynching. 
The Muslims will be forced to leave J & K or they will have to live as second class citizens as it is in all other states of India.
Modi is one of the most dishonest individuals in the modern world. 
The people of J & K should not and must not believe this tricky beast.
If the people of J & K believe this culprit they will definitely go to hell."

F3Frcn4q7OI,LIVE: PM Modi Addresses the Nation on The Abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir,"Every move this govt has taken overnight has deliberately failed later on... 
GST - People thought it's a good move only to fail later on cause loses t. 
Demonetisation - Overnight decision accepted by people thinking good move to counter black money n terrorism but only to be biggest failure in Indian history claimed by RBI. 
Pulwama attack - Waging a war with Pakistan without concrete evidence by gaining public sympathy.. Only to be realized by the public that war is not the solution but peace is. 
3000 Crore statue - Built in the name of increasing tourism but again to be found the biggest wastage of tax payers money and economic loss. 
Major Indian banks are under loss, beti padhao beti bachao again a failure - rapes on a daily basis with bjp mlas as culprits in many,  45%criminals in the parliament,  High unemployment rate in 45 yrs,  no 15 lkhs in account as promised,  increase in farmer genocide, Mob lynchings increasing everyday,  Terrorist are given place in parliament,  Rapists riots accused in parliament instead of jail,  Cheap low n sexist remarks by bjp mlas daily without any action being taken against them,  Youths are just focused and brainwashed into taking revenge with minorities and Hindu Muslim mandir masjid Pakistan everywhere instead of jobs and economic development. 

Likewise all those people who were happy when demonetisation and statue building only to criticize later for the failure keep this thing in mind you are going to repent article 370 after 2 yrs when the reports and data are out . As usual you are going to witness this failure later on not now and many more failures of this govt.. The point I'm trying to make is think brainstorm apply logic by considering the past history of this govt and then decide... Anything which this govt has promised has not been fulfilled,  but they have done everything which they have nt promised..... We are heading towards dictatorship this is not democracy,  same thing happened with people of Iraq Libya Syria and by the time those people realized the truth they were almost finished and were fighting for ter rights,  look at the situation in Syria... It's time to oppose ter moves now else we never could again.. The best example is Kashmir's itself by locking them up in ter houses by applying army force.. 

TODAY IT WAS KASMIRIS TOMORROW IT COULD BE ANY OTHER STATE WE NEVER KNOW...ITS OUR FUTURE ITS NEXT GENERATION S FUTURE AND MOREOVER ITS INDIAS FUTURE.... THE Prime Minister is riots accused of mass murdering,  the home minister is murder accused,  falsifying evidence accused, and many other..... Such criminals are making decisions for India ..GREAT THIS IS NEW INDIA 🙏🙏🙏"

Integration will never happen by force and your decision will surely be counter productive! Inqilab zindabad!

I admire Indians since they were victims of the Muslim invasion that destroyed many of their temples and killed millions of Indians, but they still resist today.

F3Usk8prmKo,Yashwant Sinha On Article 370 &amp; Jammu And Kashmir,"All we say that Drastic, Brute Force may rebound badly on us. In today era of Globalisation and Social Media, popular resentment is being seen and observed by everyone thru-out the world. We can't supress it. It would have been better had such decisions (Annulment of A370 and A35A) taken with confidence of a functional J&K Legislative Assembly for more legitimacy. We are trading in unchartered waters, so govt should be prepared for facing  repercussion. If we as Indian can condemn Human Rights Violation of Uighurs in Xinjiang Province, so does others can condemn of our actions on pretext of HR Violation. 

Also, don't forget about India's Position/Situation in the subcontinent because of Rising China and Geopolitics of the South Asia. 

Also, for God's Sake Don't Give it a communal colour. 

This issue opened the Pandora Box of Demand of Separate States which is a threat to Unity and Sovereignty of India. This is in reference to the speech of Mr. Biswajit Daimary (BPF Rajya Sabha Member from Assam) who supported the  Abrogation of A370 bill and Trifurcation of the State, and asked for similar Bifurcation of the State of Assam into Bodoland (bordering Bhutan) and Rest of Assam. If this trend continues that North East will become a mini Europe into 15-20 states alone.

F3Usk8prmKo,Yashwant Sinha On Article 370 &amp; Jammu And Kashmir,"Black Day for Indian Democracy: Majority of Indian are supporting Abrogation of Article 370 & Article 35A as they are not on the receiving end of such action. This will further increase the insecurities of the people of J&K.  People of rest of India can't supercede voice of People of J&K. They are forgetting that this is a bad precedent against Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19 (supression of Free Speech of the Political Leaders of J&K by House Arresting). Similarly,  all the Legislation concerning Protection of Rights of Indigenous People should be abrogated (like Reservations for Locals in AP, MH, KN, TN) for realising the Goal of Akhand Bharat.

Another reality is that we have become an intolerant society propelled by hypernationalism to such an extent that even so called ""secular party"" will stop dissenting to unconstitutional bills in fear of losing majority population support  in Election (Rahul Gandhi and  Dijvijay Singh stunt of proving a better Hindu than their counterparts). We should respect will of the people. How can we say that Abrogation of A370 is the will of the people when the Lok Sabha and Panchayat Election Voting percentage was 10% and 5% respectively in Kashmir Valley. The danger of a strong government is that it takes decision in a hurry and brute force rather than by consensus."

we need to cleanup your shit... you idiots... You don't have rights to blame BJP and MODI....


Understand the correct reason as follows:
The correct reason for Artl 370 scrapping is
1) At present kashmiri youths are being radicalised by viral terrorist groups, This now requires a powerful ANTIVIRUS.
2) In Kashmir, upuntill 1990, the population of Hindus and muslims were in Balance,
     The hindu King Maharaja Hari-singh handed over kashmir state to India and the instrument of accession underlines that KASHMIR belongs to INDIA.
3)  INDIA is large hearted and Kind as ever, and willingly accepted those muslims who wanted to stay back in @t it is duty of my INDIA to protect those helpless muslims from Viral terrorists.
4) Please note that,  INDIA tolereted all the atrocities of the mughal empire rule.
    a) Raping hindu women, converting them to Islam.
    b) Demolishing thousands of Hindu temples, and looting away the treasure!!!!
   c) forcing Hindus to eat cow meat.
   4) After the mughal rule the British rule started,  Initially Hindus and muslims were living harmoniously,
The fact is even muslims were respecting hindu sentiments and were not eating cow.
But after few decades the Britishers used muslims to divide India on religion basis, by employing Muslims as butchers and slaughtering cows!!! (whis is anti-hindu)
5) INDIA is very matured and very  strong emotionally, and physically,"

maTFJ2-i8qU,Jammu &amp; Kashmir Reorganisation Bill Passes in Rajya Sabha,72 years and 72 virgins later
maTFJ2-i8qU,Jammu &amp; Kashmir Reorganisation Bill Passes in Rajya Sabha,"When Bernard Lewis put forward his thesis titled “Balkanisations of the Middle East” in 1992, he predicted that a trend that had shaped the world in the 20th Century would also be highly influential in the new century.

The last century went down in history as a period when radical nationalism divided countries, nations and regions. It is natural that everyone loves and wants to protect his own nation, but radical nationalism, which violates other people’s right to life and empowers itself through the oppression of others, brought a lot of pain to the world. Central Europe was divided into many small states. New borders were drawn for the Balkans. The map of the Arabian Peninsula changed significantly. The former Soviet Union was divided into dozens of new states. Africa, South America and Far East Asia all took their share of this new world order. The number of countries in the world, which was around 77 at the dawn of the 20th Century, reached approximately 200 by the end of it.

A large majority of these divisions were the result of a bloody process. Balkan peoples, who had been living together for 500 years, started fighting with each other. Millions of innocent lives were lost, and many more had to abandon their homes. When Central Europe was divided into small states, it laid the foundation for the Second World War. Civil wars and regional conflicts were constantly present in Asia and Africa due to the divisions. Warlords took control of the majority of these conflict zones. Mass murders and genocides followed one after another. The trend of division took millions of lives.

A change at this magnitude in the world political map has brought many problems with it. First of all, the seeds of hatred, the effects of which would last for decades, were sown among the sister communities that lived together for many years. Secondly, the divisions were followed by large waves of migration as millions of women, children and the elderly had to leave their homes. Another important problem was the unsolvable border disputes. Artificial borders, that have no historical, geographical or social foundation have become reasons for conflicts that often dragged the countries into a hot war.

The Indian subcontinent witnessed events that are similar to those happening in many other parts of the world. Today, the Bengal region, often referred to as a conflict zone, was one of the richest regions in the world not long but only 300 years ago. It had an economy of 90 billion USD and a population of 150 million. These figures corresponded to the 20% of the world gross national product and 25% of the world’s population. A sense of civilization with many architectural structures that symbolizes wealth, such as Taj Mahal, was prevalent in the region. The Babylonian Empire brought order, peace and wealth to the region.

In the 18th Century, the Empire was divided into small states and disintegrated. The British who came to the region a century ago for commercial purposes took control of the Indian subcontinent by establishing colonial governments and the region remained as a British colony for 200 years. The local people were considered as second-class citizens, and even as uncivilized, primitive beings, and were subjected to inconceivable cruelty. During this time, hundreds of thousands of Indians lost their lives in the occupation wars of the British. Millions of innocent people died of starvation in the four planned major famines. All the resources of a giant civilization built on an area of millions of square kilometers were seized by the colonists. (1)

After World War II, this vast area experienced yet another division. The country was divided as Pakistan, which had a Muslim majority, and India, which had a Hindu majority. Like every division of the 20th Century, India’s division was also bloody. More than one million lives were lost, 15 million people migrated. After independence, there have been three great wars between these two countries. The departure of the British was as bloody as their arrival in every region it occupied. In the same period, three million civilian lives were lost in the civil war in Pakistan. East Pakistan seceded from the country under the name of Bangladesh. (2)

The imperialist forces have invariably left behind never-ending conflict zones. These conflict zones were a means of keeping the regions where they physically withdrew under their control. Disagreements in the Northern Kashmir region continue to this day. The Muslim-populated region was left to Hindus during the division; it should have been obvious that such a decision would result in violence. India and Pakistan fought over Kashmir in 1947, 1965 and 1999. A referendum that could easily end the conflicts has never materialized nor is it likely to do so in the immediate future. The region is now divided into three de facto regions after their giant northern neighbor China entered into the equation.(3) At the end of the 1980’s, a new conflict emerged in the region in which 70,000 civilians died; about 8,000 civilians are missing. It is generally acknowledged that the missing persons are most likely to be found buried in mass graves, which are being discovered every day.(4)

It is impossible for violence of this magnitude to occur on its own. The atmosphere of conflict is the most important strategy of those who plan to divide other countries. In this way, they are able to call the shots behind closed doors, sell weapons, and control the economy. Most importantly, they can continue to utilize the region to accomplish their own aims. In the meantime, as always, it is the innocent people who suffer during this process as a nation’s energy is exhausted in endless conflicts. Violence occupies the region.

What needs to be done to bring peace to the region, especially to Kashmir, is to build a rational and temperate culture where all the peoples are treated as first-class citizens, instead of creating a political understanding based on conventional interests. In the case of Kashmir, it is unrealistic to think of a system that Pakistan is not involved with. Pakistan, unlike India, is a part of a great family, the Muslim world. Muslims are also the spiritual guardians of Kashmir. India is one of the countries that the Islamic world considers as a friend and a brother. India’s economic and political interests lie in its friendship with the Muslim world. No matter where, the contest of military prowess is always unwinnable and it will only cause more bloodshed. It is the friendship-based alliances that will render the countries stronger and allow people to live in prosperity. Such an alliance would create a deterrent force no weapon can provide. Pakistan and India do not need new weapons, but new alliances. It is the reign of peace in the region which will bring comfort to the people, not conflict."

1)🤔NOW JK & LADAKH IS UNDER PRESIDENT RULE.
 IF THE BJP WANTS TO DO THE DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY ARE CLAIMING, IN THESE REGIONS THEY CAN VERY WELL DO WITHOUT BIFURCATIONS. 

2)🤗 EVEN THE PRESIDENT RULE CAN BE EXTENDED IF THEY WANT FOR COMPLETING CORE DEVELOPMENTS.

3)🤔 IF THE BJP THOUGHT TO ELIMINATE THE TERRORISTS/ TRAITORS IT CAN BE DONE EASILY TO MAINTAIN PEACEFUL LIVING CONDITIONS. 

4)😠😠 IF THE BENEFITS GIVEN UNDER ARTICLE 370 WERE LOOTED BY POLITICIANS IN THE YESTER YEARS IN JK, THE ACTIONS MAY BE INITIATED TO RECOVER THE MONEY/ ASSETS  AND USE IT FOR DEVELOPMENTS LIKE INDUSTRIAL AND INFRA, EDUCATION OF JK.

5)😳😲 AFTER SEEING THE DEVELOPMENTS BY BJP THE JK PEOPLE WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY TRAITORS AND PAK AS THEY WILL GET EMPLOYMENTS.

6)🤓😄 THE PEOPLE OF JK LADAKH WILL LIVE PEACEFULLY WITHOUT ANY RELIGIONS HATRED MINDSETS.

🤑👿BUT THE BJP GOVT's MINDSET IS NOT THE DEVELOPMENTS AND GROWTH OF THE JK & LADAKH.

1)👹👺ONLY TO CREATE UNREST AMONGST THE JK PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THE MUSLIMS AND PLEASE THE JAMMU HINDU PEOPLE, WHO VOTED TO BJP.

2) 👽TO IMPLEMENT THE 10% RESERVATIONS FOR THE BENEFITS OF HINDU PANDITS.

3) 😛😝INFUTURE, IT IS GOING TO BE MORE VIOLENCES IN JK AMONGST THE PEOPLE OF HINDU AND MUSILMS.
4)😢😥 DUE TO ACTIONS BY THE MILITARY AND TERRORISTS LOSS OF LIVES OF CIVILIAN, SOLDIERS AND SET  BACK IN DEVELOPMENTS IN ALL SEGMENTS, UNPEACEFUL LIVING CONDITIONS EVERYWHERE.

5) 😧😩INTERFERENCES OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKE PAK, CHINA,US LIKE THAT IS GOING TO BE CERTAIN.

6)😭😭 CONSEQUENCES OF THESE, OUR ENTIRE NATION WILL SUFFER ALL DIAMENTONS OF DEVELOPMENTS AND ECONOMY.

7)😭 ALREADY FROM 2014 MODI GOVT.OUR NATION IS CONTINUOUSLY SUFFERING SET BACK ON ECONOMIC GROWTHS, LOSS OF EMPLOYMENTS, TENSIONED HATRED RELIGIONS GROUPS BJP POLITICS.

8)😢😥WHAT ARE WE GOING TO ACHIEVE BY THIS FANATICAL SCRAPING THE PROVISIONS OF 370 & 35A...??

9)😩😩CAN THE BJP MODI AND SHAH ASSURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF INDIA N JK ARE GOING TO HAVE HEAVEN'S LIVING CONDITIONS..??

10)😢😥DEFINETLY OUR NATION IS GOING ACHIEVE ONLY FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRY TO UNDER DEVELOPED COUNTRY AND NOT 5 TRILLION DOLLER GROWTH COUNTRY BEFORE 2019, DUE TO CONTRAVERCIAL ISSUES/ PROJECTS/ POLICIES OF FANATICALS GOYAPALS BJP GOVERNMENT FROM 2014.

zM4Wvv49eag,Jammu and Kashmir Principal Secretary And IG Kashmir Address Media,"Brutal Racist INDIAN GOVT. INTERNATIONALLY BETRAYED rights of Kashmiris & BREACHED UN RESOLUTION 1948 and other UN resolutions.  Inter. recognized disputed Kashmir territory which Indian Govt signed and agreed that it will be solved with the wills of Kashmiris by referendum: But currently, Leaders of Kashmir r home arrest, innocent people r locked down , internet/mobile service is shut down. Cluster toy bombs thrown by indian army. Kashmir is the Biggest Jail/prison of the world at the moment. Illegal, unlawful and illegitimate act by Indian Govt. Violation of Human rights from more than 70 years. People are cut down from the world and pushed to Dark age. Army Killed and tortured (via pellet guns, tear gases and beaten severely) thousands of innocent people, including children and women from last 70 years by brutal racist indian army. Yes it is CALM becz everyone is home arrest."

zM4Wvv49eag,Jammu and Kashmir Principal Secretary And IG Kashmir Address Media,"Why don't you just life the ban on communication(mobile phones, landlines, internet etc.).What are you afraid of? You don't want the entire world to know that you are actually committing genocide there. That you have killed a lot of people already & injured many with pellets. Hospitals are seeing an increasingly large number of people admitted due to pellet injuries, tear gas. And others were shot dead. The WHOLE world is watching you right now. I am sure what you are doing pleases your supporters(elections are coming in many states soon..Good political move but short term without thinking about its long term implications.just like the failed demonetization blunder ) .The rest of the world, HOWEVER, is still out there. They already know the democracy in India is a sham."
